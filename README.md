![ClimaX Banner]([https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=ClimaX+Smart+Activity+Planner+Demo+GIF](https://github.com/FatemaTaher/Nasa_Smart-_Activity_Planner/blob/main/1.png))

A revolutionary smart activity planner that leverages decades of historical climate data from NASA to predict future weather patterns and generate optimized daily schedules. This project was developed for the **NASA Space Apps Cairo** challenge, showcasing an innovative approach to weather forecasting and AI-driven planning.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **📈 Historical Trend Analysis:** Analyzes over 40 years of NASA climate data to predict future weather with remarkable accuracy.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Scheduling:** Integrates with a local large language model (Ollama) to create intelligent, weather-aware activity plans.
- **🕐 Granular Hourly Predictions:** Goes beyond daily averages to provide hour-by-hour temperature forecasts for precise planning.
- **📊 Interactive Visualizations:** Displays complex weather trends and data with clear, intuitive charts and graphs.
- **🌍 Multi-City Support:** Allows users to plan activities in various cities worldwide.



## 🤖 My Role & Contributions

I was the lead **Backend & Data Engineer** on the team. My primary focus was to build the project's analytical and predictive core from the ground up. My key contributions include:

- **🔗 Data Pipeline Architecture:** Designed and implemented the entire system to fetch, clean, and process over 40 years of historical weather data from the NASA POWER API.
- **📈 Predictive Modeling Engine:** Developed a unique forecasting model using linear regression to predict daily and hourly temperatures based on long-term climate trends.
- **⚙️ Core Logic & Integration:** Built the entire application backend using Python and Streamlit, seamlessly integrating the data model with the local AI model (Ollama) to generate smart schedules.
- **🔧 Data Visualization:** Implemented the logic for generating the interactive trend analysis charts using Matplotlib.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Source:** NASA POWER API
- **AI Model:** Ollama (Llama2)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (by teammates)
