![ClimaX Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=ClimaX+Smart+Activity+Planner+Demo+GIF)

A revolutionary smart activity planner that leverages decades of historical climate data from NASA to predict future weather patterns and generate optimized daily schedules. This project was developed for the **NASA Space Apps Cairo** challenge, showcasing an innovative approach to weather forecasting and AI-driven planning.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **📈 Historical Trend Analysis:** Analyzes over 40 years of NASA climate data to predict future weather with remarkable accuracy.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Scheduling:** Integrates with a local large language model (Ollama) to create intelligent, weather-aware activity plans.
- **🕐 Granular Hourly Predictions:** Goes beyond daily averages to provide hour-by-hour temperature forecasts for precise planning.
- **📊 Interactive Visualizations:** Displays complex weather trends and data with clear, intuitive charts and graphs.
- **🌍 Multi-City Support:** Allows users to plan activities in various cities worldwide.

## 👥 The Team
